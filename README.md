# ChIP-Sequencing
This project presents a complete ChIP-seq analysis pipeline for identifying and functionally annotating histone H3K27ac enrichment sites in human K562 leukemia cells. H3K27ac is a histone modification associated with active enhancers and promoters, making it a key marker for gene regulation and transcriptional activation.
